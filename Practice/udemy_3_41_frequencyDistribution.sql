/* Frequency Distributions 
understanding data patterns */

-- Frequency Distributions are a fundamental tool in data analysis, providing a structured way to organize and summarize data. They help us uncover patterns and trends within datasets, enabling us to gain valuable insights.

-- Types of Frequency Distributions
-- -- Ungrouped 
-- -- -- -- Ungrouped frequency distributions are used when we want to show the frequency of each individual value in a dataset. This type of distribution is best suited for datasets with a limited number of unique values.
-- -- -- -- For example, if we were looking at the number of students in each grade level at a school, we could create an ungrouped frequency distribution to show how many students are in each grade.
-- -- Grouped
-- -- -- -- Grouped frequency distributions are used when we have a large number of unique values in our dataset. In this case, we group the data into ranges or intervals to make it easier to analyze.alter
-- -- -- -- For example, if we were looking at the ages of people in a city, we could create a grouped frequency distribution to show how many people are in each age range (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc).
